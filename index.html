            Python is a high level general-purpose programming language. It uses a multi-paradigm approach, meaning it supports procedural, object-oriented, and some functional programming constructs.
          </p>
          <p>
            It was created by Guido van Rossum as a successor to another language (called ABC) between 1985 and 1990, and is currently used on a large array of domains like web development, desktop applications, data science, DevOps, and automation/productivity.
          </p>
          <p>
            Python is developed under an OSI-approved open source license, making it freely usable and distributable, even for commercial use. Python's license is administered by the <a href="https://www.python.org/psf-landing/">Python Software Foundation</a>.

          <header>Python Install</header>
          <p>Many PCs and Macs will have python already installed.</p>
          <p>To check if you have python installed on a Windows PC, search in the start bar for Python or run the following on the Command Line (cmd.exe):</p>
          <code>C:\Users\Your Name>python --version</code>
          <p>To check if you have python installed on a Linux or Mac, then on linux open the command line or on Mac open the Terminal and type:</p>
          <code>python --version</code>
          <p>If you find that you do not have Python installed on your computer, then you can download it for free from the following website: <a href="https://www.python.org/">https://www.python.org/</a></p>

          <p>Python and C++ both are the most popular and general-purpose programming languages. They both support Object-Oriented Programming (OPP) yet they are a lot different from one another. In this article, we will discuss how Python is different from C++.</p>

          <p>Python has a set of built-in math functions, including an extensive math module, that allows you to perform mathematical tasks on numbers.</p>
          <p>The min() and max() functions can be used to find the lowest or highest value in an iterable:</p>
          <code>x = min(5, 10, 25)
y = max(5, 10, 25)
print(x)
print(y)</code>
          <p>The abs() function returns the absolute (positive) value of the specified number:</p>
          <code>x = abs(-7.25)
print(x)</code>
          <p>The pow(x, y) function returns the value of x to the power of y (xʸ).</p>
          <code>x = pow(4, 3)
print(x)</code>
          <p>Return the value of 4 to the power of 3 (same as 4 * 4 * 4).</p>
